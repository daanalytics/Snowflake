# Using Python and Snowflake ❄️ together

Python and Snowflake go well together. Check various scripts and examples here.

Connecting Python to Snowflake is a recurring case in the examples here. How you can set a connection up is descrbed [*here*](https://github.com/daanalytics/Snowflake/blob/master/python/SF_connect_Py2SF.md).

- [*From Kaggle to Snowflake*](https://github.com/daanalytics/Snowflake/blob/master/python/F1DemoConnectKaggle.py) is an alternative solution for the previous example where we loaded .csv-files into Snowflake. This time we loaded the data directly from Kaggle. See the [*blogpost*](https://daanalytics.medium.com/from-kaggle-to-snowflake-feebae94ad2a) to see how things work.   

- [*From .csv to Snowflake*](https://github.com/daanalytics/Snowflake/blob/master/python/F1createDemo.py) is an example of how to read from .csv-files, create Snowflake objects an load Data into Snowflake. Maybe not the most obvious solution to load data into Snowflake. Still interesting to see how you can use Panda Data Frames in relation to Snowflake. The [*blogpost*](https://daanalytics.medium.com/from-csv-to-snowflake-46889eabbad6) explains things in a little bit more detail. 

*Streamlit* is an interesting alternative for Power BI dashboards. Find some of the examples in the [*Streamlit-folder*](https://github.com/daanalytics/Snowflake/blob/master/python/streamlit/)
